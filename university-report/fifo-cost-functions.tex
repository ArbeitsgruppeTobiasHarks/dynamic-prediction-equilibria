\section{Time-Dependent FIFO Cost Functions}\label{sec:fifo-costs}

Time-dependent cost functions that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) rule are very important for the algorithms introduced later.
We begin by defining the FIFO rule in a directed graph $(V, E)$.


\begin{definition}
    A time-dependent cost function $c: \R\rightarrow \R_{\geq0}^E$ \emph{follows the FIFO rule} if for all edges $e\in E$ the function $T_e: \theta\mapsto \theta + c_e(\theta)$ is monotone increasing.
    It \emph{follows the strong FIFO rule} if $T_e$ is strictly increasing for all $e\in E$.
    The function $T_e$ is called \emph{traversal time} of $e$.
\end{definition}

For the following we concentrate on a graph $(V,E)$ where all nodes can reach a specific sink node $t\in V$.
Moreover, let $c:\R\rightarrow \R_{\geq0}^E$ be a time-dependent cost function.

The traversal time $T_P$ of a path $P = e_1\,\cdots\,e_k$ is given by the concatenation of the edges' traversal times as $T_P \coloneqq T_{e_k} \circ \cdots \circ T_{e_1}$.
The set of all simple $v$-$t$-Paths is denoted as $\paths_{v,t}$.
The \emph{earliest arrival time} at $t$ when starting at time $\theta$ in $v$ is then given by $l_{v,t}(\theta)\coloneqq \min_{P\in\paths_{v,t}} T_P(\theta)$.
Paths that attain this minimum are called \emph{shortest $v$-$t$-Path at time $\theta$}.

We call an edge $e=vw\in E$ \emph{active at time $\theta$}, if the condition $l_{v,t}(\theta) = l_{w,t}(T_e(\theta))$ holds true.
The set of active edges at time $\theta$ is collected in $E(\theta)$.
\todo[inline]{
    Isn't it disturbing, that these edges might not lie on a \textbf{simple} shortest path?
