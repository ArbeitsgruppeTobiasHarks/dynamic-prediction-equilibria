\subsection{Dynamic Prediction Equilibrium}\label{subsec-dynamic-prediction-equilibrium}

To enable a game theoretic perspective on dynamic flows, the infinitesimally small particles are interpreted as agents belonging to a commodity $i\in I$.
An agent gets generated at some time at the source node $s_i$.
Each time an agent arrives at a node, it can update its route based on historical traffic data of the network.
More specifically, each commodity has its own prediction method to predict future queue lengths on all edges of the network.
Based on the predicted queue lengths an agent now determines a time-dependent shortest path starting from his current position to $t_i$.

More formally, for a commodity $i\in I$ the \emph{predicted queue length} of an edge $e$ at time $\theta$ as predicted at time $\bar\theta$ based on the historical queue lengths $q=(q_e)_{e\in E}$ is given by $\predq_{i,e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q)$.
Aside from the predicted queue lengths all other predicted values will be denoted with a hat. 
This means, each commodity $i$ has a set of predictor functions $(\predq_{i,e})_{e\in E}$ each of which has the following the signature:
\[
    \predq_{i,e} : \R_{\geq 0} \times \R_{\geq 0} \times \contFcts{\R_{\geq 0}}{\R_{\geq 0}}^E \rightarrow \R_{\geq0},
\]
where $\contFcts{A}{B}$ denotes the set of all continuous functions from $A$ to $B$.

Based on the predicted queue lengths we can also determine \emph{predicted queue costs} by \[
    \predc_{i,e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q) \coloneqq \transit_e + \frac{\predq_{i,e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q)}{\capa_e}.
\]
The \emph{predicted traversal time of an edge $e=vw$} is the predicted arrival time at $w$ when entering edge $e$ at time $\theta$ defined as $\predT_{i,e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q) \coloneqq \theta + \predc(\theta, \bar\theta, q)$.
The \emph{predicted traversal time of a path $P=e_1\,e_2\,\cdots\,e_k$} is thus defined as \[
    \predT_{i,P}(\theta,\bar\theta, q) \coloneqq \left(
        \predT_{i,e_k}(\emptyArg, \bar\theta, q) \circ \cdots \circ \predT_{i,e_1}(\emptyArg, \bar\theta, q)
    \right) (\theta).
\]

For all nodes $v$ that can reach $t_i$, we denote the set of all simple $v$-$t_i$-paths as $\paths_{v,t_i}$.
We can then determine the \emph{predicted earliest arrival time} at $t_i$ when starting in $v$ at time $\theta$ by
\[
    \predl_{v,i}(\theta, \bar\theta, q) \coloneqq \min_{P \in \paths_{v,t_i}} \predT_{i, P}(\theta,\bar\theta, q).
\]
We call a path that attains this minimum a \emph{$\bar\theta$-predicted shortest $v$-$t_i$-path at time $\theta$}.
Before we continue, we want to make sure, that this definition of shortest-paths is sensible:
We can only restrict ourselves to simple paths, if waiting at a node -- or traveling through a short cycle -- is never helpful.
This can be realized by assuming the FIFO-property of predictors:
\begin{definition}
    A time-dependent cost function $c: \R\rightarrow \R_{\geq0}^E$ \emph{follows the FIFO-rule} if for all $e\in E$ and $\theta_1,\theta_2\in\R$ it holds that $\theta_1 + c_e(\theta_1) \leq \theta_2 + c_e(\theta_2)$ for $\theta_1\leq \theta_2$.

    A set of predictors $(\predq_{i,e})_{e\in E}$ \emph{follows the FIFO-rule} if $(\predc_{i,e}(\emptyArg, \bar\theta, q))_{e\in E}$ follows the FIFO-rule for all $\bar\theta\in\R_{\geq0}, q\in\contFcts{\R_{\geq0}}{\R_{\geq0}}$.
\end{definition}

We note, that a set of predictors $(\predq_{i,e})_{e\in E}$ follows the FIFO-rule if and only if the predicted traversal times $T_{i,e}(\emptyArg, \bar\theta, q)$ of all edges $e\in E$ are monotone increasing for all $\bar\theta\in\R, q\in\contFcts{\R_{\geq0}}{\geq0}$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:removing-cycles-in-fifo-graphs}
    Let $v\in V_i$ be a node and  $(\predq_{i,e})_{e\in E}$  a set of predictors following the FIFO-rule.
    Then removing a cycle in any $v$-$t_i$-path $P$ does not increase its predicted traversal time.

    More specifically, if $P=P_1\circ C \circ P_2$ is the concatenation of paths $P_1$, a cycle $C$ and another path $P_2$, then for all $\theta,\bar\theta,q$ it holds that
    \[
        \predT_{i,P}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) \geq \left(
        \predT_{i,P_2}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta,q)
        \circ \predT_{i,P_1}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta,q)
    \right)(\theta).
    \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The statement is a direct result of the monotonicity of $\predT_{i,P_2}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta,q)$ and the fact that $\predT_{i,C}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) \geq \theta$ holds for all $\theta\in\R$.\end{proof}

\todo[inline]{
    Here, we are missing the system-of-equations to which $(\predl_{v,i}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta, q))_{v\in V_i}$ is the unique solution.
    Maybe we need the FIFO-property for that.
}

\begin{proposition}
    For all $i\in I, \bar\theta\in \R, q\in\contFcts{\R_{\geq0}}{\R_{\geq0}}$, the vector $(\predl_{v,i}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta, q))_{v\in V_i}$ of functions is the unique solution of the following system of equations in the function-valued variables $(l_v)_{v\in V_i}$:
    \[
        l_v(\theta) = \begin{cases}
            \theta, &\text{if $v = t_i$}, \\
            \min_{\substack{
                e=vw\in\outEdges{v}\\
                w \in V_i                
            }} l_w\left(
                \predT_{i, e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q)
            \right), &\text{otherwise}.
        \end{cases}
    \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    To see that $(\predl_{v,i}(\emptyArg,\bar\theta, q))_{v\in V_i}$ is a solution of the system, we note that for $v = t_i$ we have $\predl_{v,i}(\theta, \bar\theta,q) = \theta$.
    For $v\neq t_i$ let $e=vw\in\outEdges{v}$ be an edge with $w\in V_i$.
    Let $P$ be a $\bar\theta$-predicted shortest $w$-$t_i$-path at time $\predT_{i,e}(\theta,\bar\theta, q)$.
    Let $P'\coloneqq e\circ P$ be the concatenation of $e$ and $P$.

    If $P'$ contains a cycle, then it must have been introduced by $e$ and $v$ must be visited a second time in $P'$.
    Removing this cycle gives a simple $v$-$t_i$-path $Q$ with 
    \[
        \predl_{i,v}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) \leq \predT_{i,Q}(\theta,\bar\theta,q)\leq \predT_{i,P'}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) = \predl_{i,w}(\predT_{i,e}(\theta,\bar\theta, q),\bar\theta,q)
    \]
    by Proposition~\ref{prop:removing-cycles-in-fifo-graphs}.
    If $P'$ does not contain a cycle, we follow analogously
    \[
        \predl_{i,v}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) \leq \predT_{i,P'}(\theta,\bar\theta,q) = \predl_{i,w}(\predT_{i,e}(\theta,\bar\theta, q),\bar\theta,q).
    \]
    This shows that $\predl_{i,v}(\theta,\bar\theta,q)$ is a lower bound on $\{ l_w(
        \predT_{i, e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q)
    ) \mid e=vw\in\outEdges{v}, w\in V_i  \}$.
    Now, let $P = e_1\, \cdots\, e_k$ be a $\bar\theta$-predicted shortest $v$-$t_i$-path at time $\theta$ and let $e_1=vw$ and $P' = e_2\,\cdots\,e_k$.
    Furthermore, let $Q$ be a $\bar\theta$-predicted shortest $w$-$t_i$-path at time $\predT_{i,e_1}(\theta,\bar\theta,q)$.
    Assume $\predT_{i,P}(\theta,\bar\theta, q) > \predl_{i,w}(\predT_{i,e_1}(\theta,\bar\theta,q), \bar\theta, q)$.
    This implies
    \[
        \predT_{i,P}(\theta,\bar\theta, q) > 
        \predT_{i,Q}(\predT_{i,e_1}(\theta,\bar\theta,q), \bar\theta, q),
    \]
    such that removing any cycles in the path $e_1\circ Q$ would yield a shorter path than $P$.

    \todo{show uniqueness}
    Let $(l_v)_{v\in V_i}$ be a solution of the system of equations and let $P_v$ be a $\bar\theta$-predicted shortest path at time $\theta$.
    We first show, that $\predl_{v,i}(\theta,\bar\theta, q)\leq l_v(\theta)$ holds for all $v\in V_i$ and $\theta\in\R$.
    Assume the contrary and pick the 
\end{proof}

An edge $e=vw$ is called \emph{active} for commodity $i\in I$ at time $\theta\in\R$ as predicted at time~$\bar\theta$, if the equality $\predl_{i,v}(\theta, \bar\theta, q) = \predl_{i,w}{\left(
        \predT_{i, e}(\theta, \bar\theta, q)
    \right)}$ holds.
All active edges of a commodity $i$ are collected in the set $\predE_i(\theta, \bar\theta, q)$. 

We can now define an equilibrium based on these predictors, in which all agents only take shortest paths at all times based on their current prediction.
\begin{definition}
    A pair $(\predq, f)$ of a set of predictors $(\predq_{i,e})_{i\in I, e\in E}$ and a dynamic flow $f$ is a \emph{dynamic prediction equilibrium (DPE)} if for all $e\in E, i\in I$ and $\theta\geq 0$ it holds that
    \[
        \infl_{i,e}(\theta) > 0 \implies e \in \predE_i(\theta, \theta, q).
    \]
\end{definition}

In other words, a pair of a set of predictors and a flow is a DPE, if whenever flow enters an edge at some time $\theta$, then the prediction of that commodity evaluated at the same time $\theta$ says, that the edge lies on a dynamic shortest path to $t_i$.
